# Simple step for huge productivity improvement

I though simply adding `127.0.0.1 facebook.com` in my host files wasn't enough and wanted a page that nicely remembered me that I should be working instead. Also added a replacement page for the like button.

## Pros
- no more “cmd+t – f – enter” automatism.
- no more tracking from facebook while browsing webpages.
- no more zombie-clicking through pictures at 3 in the morning.

## Cons
- Mark Zuckerberg won't be happy.
